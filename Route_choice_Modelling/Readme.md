# Route Choice Modelling Attribute Derivation For London Underground

## Description:
For building a MNL model for route choice modelling, we required attributes for each available route. Route choices can be varied person to person and their choices depends on the parameters like fare, total travel time, number of transfers, source waiting time and time between the transfers along the route. Since London underground is metro where the fare will not change with respect to route for OD. So, no need to derive the fare for the metro. For the MNL model, following attributes are considered and derived using GTFS data set.
* Number of Transfers
* Total Travel time
* Transfers time
* In-vehicle travel time
* Path Size
